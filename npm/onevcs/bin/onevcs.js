// package.
//
// Like the PyPI wheels (maturin `bindings = "bin"`, see pyproject.toml), the npm
// distribution carries the *prebuilt* Rust binary — no Rust toolchain, no
// compile, no download at install time. The platform-specific binary ships
// inside a per-platform package (`onevcs-cli-<platform>-<arch>`) declared in
// this package's `optionalDependencies`; npm installs only the one whose
// `os`/`cpu` match the host, and this shim resolves it and execs it with the
// caller's argv.
//
// This file is committed source; the version and the optionalDependency versions
// are stamped from Cargo.toml at publish time by scripts/npm-build.mjs, which
// also generates the per-platform packages from the release binaries.
