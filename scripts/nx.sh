# The one entry point to this workspace's Nx.
#
# Nx lives in `node_modules/.bin`, which a fresh clone does not have, so every
# invocation heals through a locked install first. That is what lets `just check`
# work from a clean clone without a separate "install the orchestrator" step, and
# what keeps one recipe from failing with `nx: command not found` while another
# quietly repaired it.
#
# Quiet on success, specific on failure. Every gate recipe runs through here, so
# this wrapper's output *is* `just check`'s output, and a green run owes a line
# rather than Nx's whole task log. The log is preserved rather than discarded:
# `scripts/preserved-log.sh` puts it at a path both messages name, which a reader
# can `tail -f` while the run is still going and still read after it exits.
# `ONEVCS_NX_SHOW_OUTPUT=1` streams instead, for the callers that read Nx's
# stdout (`nx show projects --json`).
#
# Nx orchestrates targets; it is never a runtime dependency of the scripts it
# runs. Each target shells out to the project's own language-native tool.
