# One place, so the three consumers can never disagree about what a lane is called:
# the capture (scripts/screenshots.sh), the local pre-push guard (.githooks/pre-push),
# and `just screenshots-bless`. The names match [capture].arches in screencomp.toml,
# which is what screencomp fans CI out over.
