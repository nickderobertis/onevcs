# Durable output logs for the wrappers that capture their own output.
#
# Sourced, never executed. A script that is quiet on success has to put the
# output somewhere, and a `mktemp` file an EXIT trap removes takes the evidence
# with it exactly when a failed run is being diagnosed. A log at a deterministic
# path is readable *while* the command runs (`tail -f .logs/nx.log`) and still
# readable after it exits.
#
# One log per label, truncated per run: the newest run is the one worth keeping,
# and unbounded history inside a working tree is its own problem.
#
# "Per run" has to mean per *invocation*, though. `just check` runs the e2e suite
# through Nx, and those journeys spawn `scripts/nx.sh` again — so a nested
# invocation resolves the same `.logs/nx.log` the still-running outer one is
# writing and would truncate it, making the running gate uninspectable exactly
# when a reader needs it. Every invocation therefore records the absolute path it
# is writing in an exported claim list that descendants inherit, and one that
# finds its path already claimed takes a distinct destination rather than erasing
# evidence.
#
# No `set -euo pipefail` here, unlike every other script in this tree: this file
# is sourced, so those options would land on whatever shell sourced it, and a
# library must not reach into its caller's. Every caller runs strict already
# (`scripts/nx.sh`, and the justfile via `set shell`), and every function below
# checks and reports its own failures rather than relying on errexit.
#
# shellcheck shell=bash

#: Absolute paths of the logs that enclosing invocations are still writing, one
#: per line. Exported, so descendants inherit the set without a caller passing it.

# writing `log=$(preserved_log_open ...)` would run this in a subshell, and the
