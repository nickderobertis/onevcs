# Two modes:
#   scripts/nx-affected.sh -t check        run a target over the affected projects
#   scripts/nx-affected.sh --affects NAME  print `true`/`false` for one project
#
# Both **fail closed**: when the merge base cannot be derived — a shallow clone,
# a missing base branch, a detached build — this runs everything and says so on
# stderr rather than reporting a scoped pass as a full one. Affected selection is
# a speed optimisation, and a speed optimisation that can silently skip a check
# is a correctness hole.
#
# llmlint: ignore-file[tool_output_is_signal] the one line each fail-closed path prints is
# the correctness hole above, reported: nothing else says the scope that ran was not the
# scope asked for.
